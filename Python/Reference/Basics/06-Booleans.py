# # Booleans
# 
# Booleans are data types that indicate a logical state of **True** or **False**. Python also has a placeholder object called **None**. Let's explore what these look like. We will work with them a lot more once we begin to learn about control flow with Python, but until then, let's just get to understand what they look like (notice the syntax highlighting).

# In[1]:


# Booleans
a = True


# In[2]:


a


# In[3]:


type(a)


# In[4]:


b = False


# In[5]:


type(b)


# Later on we will learn how comparison operators return booleans.

# In[6]:


1 > 2


# In[7]:


2 == 2


# We can use None as a placeholder for an object that we don't want to reassign yet:

# In[8]:


c = None


# In[9]:


type(c)


# Finally let's learn how to deal with working with simple text files.
